# KVS
KVS is a demo project to illustrate how to support structured data model with a key value store. The implementation is intentionally made simple and missing many critical features, therefore should only be used for demonstration purpose only. There is an online article with brief introduction about this demostration project at [zhihu.com](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/47504853)
